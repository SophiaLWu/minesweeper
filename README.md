# Minesweeper
This is the classic mnesweeper game built using JavaScript as a web game.

This is a project as described in [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript-and-jquery/lessons/minesweeper?ref=lnav).

## TODO
- Can click on revealed square to reveal other squares if the flags are covering all the mines.
- Add count of flags placed (start at number of mines and decrease after each flag placed)
