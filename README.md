## Instructions

**Object of the Game**

You are given a board of squares. Some squares contain mines, others don't. You win the game if you can click all of the squares that don't contain any mines. You lose if you click any square containing a mine.

**Gameplay**
- Left-click on any square to reveal it. When you reveal a square that does not contain a mine, it will reveal the number of mines that are adjacent (including diagonals). If you reveal a square that does not have any adjacent mines, squares will continue to be revealed until a square that is adjacent to a mine is revealed.
- You can right-click an unrevealed square to mark it is a mine (and right-click again to remove the mine marker).
- If you have the appropriate number of mines marked surrounding a revealed square, you can left-click that square to automatically reveal the rest of the adjacent squares. But be careful, if you marked any incorrect mines, a mine could be revealed!
